Great that you’re here!

This is a toolset for the Golem workshop at deVcon, Osaka, Japan.
https://devcon.golem.network
Building on top of Golem with gWasm and Unlimited

You’ll find here:
- gcc
- emscripten sdk
- rust (with wasm32-unknown-emscripten target)
- python2, curl, vim and nano
- gwasm-runner (use -h to get help)

We had also prepared four examples for you:
  - hello world for gwasm runner (you’re now in its directory)
  - mandelbrot fractal example (~/mandelbrot) 
  - fully homomorphic encryption example (~/gudot)
  - easter egg: cracking challenge implemented in both Rust and C++ 

All of those can be compiled to WASM target and executed with gwasm-runner.
